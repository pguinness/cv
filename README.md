# CV Website

## Project Analysis

### User Profile
The final user of this CV website is likely to be a **potential employer**, **recruiter** or **collaborator** who wishes to learn more about my professional profile, skills and experience. This user is expecting to find a **clear**, **well-structured** and **visually appealing** portfolio that presents my qualifications and achievements in a concise yet engaging way.

### Information Architecture
The page has been carefully structured to ensure that the information is presented in a **clear**, **logical** and **accessible** manner, as well as **good-looking**. I've distributed the sections between the main content, which contains the "Experience" and "Education" sections, and a sidebar, which shows my profile picture, contact details and the "Skills" and "Languages" sections. After all that information, I added a "Portfolio" section as well.

The **Experience** section highlights my professional background, outlining previous roles in the companies where I've worked. This is followed by the **Education** section, which presents my academic achievements. Both sections are organised chronologically, allowing users to follow my professional and academic development easily.

Next, the **Skills** section focuses on my personal capabilities, which demonstrate my ability to work effectively within diverse environments. This leads naturally into the **Languages** section, which showcases the range of languages I speak and my level of proficiency in each, emphasising my ability to engage with international contexts.

Finally, the **Portfolio** section provides an overview of my projects, including a link to their GitHub repository, a short description and a list of the programming languages I used to develop them.

### Visual Design
I tried to make my website's design as **clean**, **modern** and **professional** as possible. I chose a **dark** and **minimalistic** colour palette and made use of **CSS gradients** to give a general shady look.

Regarding the typography, I chose "**Intra**" for its modern *sans-serif* style, and modified its weight along the page depending on the text's importance, to establish a clear visual hierarchy. The overall typographic system helps maintain consistency and coherence throughout the site.

The page **layout** consists of three main modules, as I specified in the "Information Architecture" part: a sidebar, the main content and the portfolio.

My design choices were inspired by professional platforms such as **LinkedIn** and **GitHub**. The Experience and Education sections follow LinkedIn's layout, and the Portfolio section draws from GitHub's project-based design, where I took the colours to represent the programming languages. The rest of the website was designed through my experimentation in **Figma**, where I explored various layouts and visual elements to create **my own distinctive style**. This approach allowed me to combine inspiration from established platforms with a personal touch that reflects both professionalism and individuality.
